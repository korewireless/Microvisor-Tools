# Microvisor Tools

This repository contains utilities to be used with Microvisor.

## Bundler

**IMPORTANT** Bundler is now deprecated: a more up-to-date version of its functionality is delivered by the Twilio CLI Microvisor Plugin, which should be used in preference to the code included here.

The Bundler tool packages compiled user code binaries (in `.elf` format) for distribution to a Microvisor device via the Microvisor cloud.

See the [`bundler-py`](bundler-py/) directory for the code, and its [Read Me](bundler-py/README.md) for details.

## Support/Feedback

We welcome all inquiries you may have about Microvisor and its implementation, and any support questions that arise once you’ve begun developing with Microvisor. Please [submit your queries via a Twilio Help Center ticket](https://help.twilio.com/submit).
